Abbreviation for **smo**l **te**mperature **c**ollector

## Intro
This project was born as a birthday present for a friend and reuses some materials I had flying around. Its purpose is to be a gadget to play around with with an actual purpose, in this case showing the current room temperature.

## Materials
In order to build, have these components around:
- Pi (Pico or Zero for the size)
- LM75A temperature sensor (at best as a package so you can plug'n'play) ([already did some experimenting](https://gist.github.com/theBreadCompany/45d2e88e474c84dc763857e80e569c82)
- a 16x2 LCD (mine has no I2C controller)
- a case, which is to be designed and 3D-printed (WIP)

## Design plan
The plan is to have a case made up off two parts: The actual case and a backplate. 
Up front, there is the LCD of course. Next, there are (the buttons (might add some, idk yet) and) the sensor(s (might include two or more and calculate an average)), then the Pi with cables and stuff. Last thing would be some kind of battery casing combined with the backplate hiding the tech.

## Construction
WIP ofc;
